/**
 * Block Helper
 *
 * Blocks are an inefficient way to solve design problems. Their usage can be quite flexible though
 * and inneficiency may not be a real big deal depending on where and when and for what. It is the
 * equivelant of making a SQL JOIN call, but for PHP instead in order to "join" html/css to make up
 * the page. Unfortunately, it's sometimes (often) necessary.
 *
 * RENDER METHOD
 * --------------
 * There are two main methods for blocks to be rendered. First is the "php" method which will call
 * external/local URLs using cURL or render view templates from the views folder
 * (by default located in: minerva/views/blocks/static).
 *
 * Rendering view templates is perhaps your most basic use for blocks. It renders
 * a "static" template from the views/blocks folder.
 * Of course those templates can also call Block->render() again or Block->requestAction().
 * This can help with organization.
 *
 * As you can start to see, with all these classes (both View and your controllers) being
 * instantiated over and over, pulling in other data is not the most effecient thing for a
 * site/CMS and breaks MVC. It's a necessary evil though.
 *
 * Not to worry! There's caching for the "php" method! So once your block template
 * (which may make several other calls that make several other calls) has been rendered,
 * it can be cached to disk (or memory, depending) using Lithium's Cache class.
 * That way, you won't be instantiating all those classes and running all those methods
 * on each request. What's even better is that you can also, more than likely, cache the
 * parent/calling view template! Caching for everyone!
 *
 * In the other corner...
 * We have our "ajax" method. This method will always make another request to the web server.
 * AJAX can not call external URLs. So why on earth would you use it? Well, maybe you don't care
 * about how many requests are coming to your server. Maybe you really need to ensure that this
 * block is never cached. Maybe you are calling another page on your site that already is cached
 * and you're just doing this so that your page can load first and have all your blocks come in
 * last for user experience. Again, note that is another request to the server, but you may weigh
 * the options and decide that you're ok with that and it's more important to have the main part of
 * the page load as fast as possible.
 * It is like using cURL, but it is done on the client side so it doesn't hold up the main page
 * from loading.
 *
 *
 * REQUEST ACTION METHOD
 * ----------------------
 * You also have another method in this helper. Called "requestAction"
 * The serves as a shortcut to instantiating controller classes and calling specific
 * methods/actions from within those controllers to return data to the page. That means those
 * methods should be built with the beforehand knowledge that they are to return data instead of
 * render views. This data can then be used directly within the view template.
 * Using this in conjunction with the render() method should give you the ability to load whatever
 * content you need into blocks.
 *
 * So, you have flexibility while at the same time maintaining a small footprint and allowing you
 * to write modular code. Remember that blocks can really hurt your site's performance if not
 * cached and there's a bunch of them.
