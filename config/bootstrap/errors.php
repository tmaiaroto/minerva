/**
 * Handles errors for Minerva.
 * By default errors are turned on and will show 404, 500, etc.
 * These errors under a "production" environment will not show any stack traces, etc.
 * Further configuration for where these templates are rendered can be provided with
 * Libraries::add('minerva', array(...))
 *
 * Options currently are:
 * 'show_errors'
 *     This is true by default and if set to false, nothing will show at all (white pages).
 *     You might as well comment out the line to include errors in Minerva's bootstrap process
 *     at that rate, but you would of course be altering "core" code technically speaking
 *     if you did so.
 *
 * 'errors_libray'
 *     This will choose the library to render templates from. So you can make a new library with
 *     a new error layout and template to use; again, avoiding the need to touch "core" code.
 *     Error layouts and templates are always named for the app environment and are not directly
 *     configurable from the options.
 *
 *     The layout will be: "error_<ENVIRONMENT>.html.php" and template will be:
 *     "<ENVIRONMENT>.html.php"
 *
 *     Specifying "app" for the 'errors_library' will look in your main app's views folder for
 *     these templates, otherwise any other library you specify with it defaulting to "minerva".
 *
 * 'development_errors'
 *     If you have your main app in "production" or some other environment, but still want to see
 *     "production" errors with anything in your app using Minerva, you can set this key to true.
 *     This will keep your app's environment to whatever you want, but still allow you to see
 *     "development" errors for Minerva.
 *     This sets the layout and template to "error_development.html.php" and "development.html.php"
 *     respectively.
 *     Please note:
 *         this does not set your environment to "development" so you will still be using
 *     the default connection setting, etc.
 *
 * This should give enough control over the errors. Of course they can be turned completely off
 * if you want to handle 404's and 500's, etc. differently. The idea is to just be able to have
 * a basic way to handle those sorts of errors in a production application and give more debugging
 * information during development.
 *
 * Of course do all this, while at the same time trying not to effect the primary application
 * if you are using the CMS on top of some other existing application.
 *
 * If it doesn't suit your needs, simply use something else.
